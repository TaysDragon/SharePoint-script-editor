## Minimal Path to Awesome

* Clone this repository
* Set the `version` node in the `package.json` file, or by using `npm version major`, `npm version minor` or `npm version patch`
* in the command line run:
  * `npm install`
  * `gulp serve`

## Features

The sample uses a custom `gulp` task to synchronize the `version` node from the NodeJS `package.json` to the SharePoint solution's `package-solution.json`.

The solution demonstrates how to import the `package-solution.json` into a web part using a static `import` and a `require` statement.

### Using npm version to set the version

To change the `package.json` version (which will also change your SharePoint solution version), use [`npm version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version), using one of the following parameters:

```cmd
npm version major
npm version minor
npm version patch
```

The following table shows when you should call which `npm version` command, depending on the types of changes you're making to your solution:

|Type of change|Stage|Versioning rule|Example version| NPM command
|---|---|---|---|---|
|First release|New solution|Start with 1.0.0|1.0.0| `npm version major`
|Backward compatible bug fixes|Patch release|Increment the third digit|1.0.1| `npm version patch`
|Backward compatible new features|Minor release|Increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero|1.1.0| `npm version minor`
|Changes that break backward compatibility|Major release|Increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero|2.0.0| `npm version major`

### To use the custom gulp task in your solutions

> NOTE: if you use the [PnP SPFx Yeoman generator](https://pnp.github.io/generator-spfx/), there is already a built-in `gulp` command that will synchronize your version number when you use `npm version`. You only need to follow the steps below if you use the regular SPFx Yeoman generator.

If you'd like to use the custom `gulp` task in your solutions, copy the code from this solution's `gulpfile.js` between:

```typescript
// BEGIN: Add custom version sync task
```

and

```typescript
// END: Add custom version sync task
```

To your own `gulpfile.js`.

### To use the version using the web part's manifest

The `BaseClientSideWebPart` class `context` property provides a `manifest` which contains a `version` property. To use it in your web part, simply use:

```typescript
this.context.manifest.version
```

This approach provides a version number that follows the `1.0.0` format, instead of the usual `1.0.0.0` format. However, since the `gulp` tasks describe above append an additional `.0` to the end of the `package.json` version number, you can choose to append `.0` yourself when displaying the manifest version. For example:

```typescript
this.context.manifest.version + '.0'
```

### To use the version using a static import

1. Copy the content of this solution's `src\typings.d.ts` to your own `src` folder in your own project.
2. In the code where you want to insert the solution version, add the following `import` statement:
```typescript
import * as packageSolution from '../../../config/package-solution.json';
```

Keep in mind that you may have to adjust the path to your `package-solution.json` depending on where you're adding the code within your solution.

### To use the version using a require

In the code where you want to insert the solution version, add the following `require` statement:
```typescript
const packageSolution: any = require("../../../config/package-solution.json");
```

Keep in mind that you may have to adjust the path to your `package-solution.json` depending on where you're adding the code within your solution.
