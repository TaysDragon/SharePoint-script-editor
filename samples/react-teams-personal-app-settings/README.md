## React Teams Personal App Settings Web Part

Sample web part that demonstrates how you can store Teams Personal App Web Part's properties in user's OneDrive.

![Teams Personal App](./assets/teams-personal-app-settings.png)

## Details

Teams Personal Apps, or Personal Tabs don't have settings.
For SPFx it means few things:
* Web Part will never be switched to Edit mode
* Property Pane will never be shown
* `this.properties` value is always undefined
But there are definitely scenarios when we want to be able to configure Personal App and store this configuration somehow.
The provided sample demonstrates how it can be achieved using custom Settings Panel and custom list in user's OneDrive.

`OneDriveListWebPartPropertiesService` can be copied from this sample to your web parts and used to implement the same approach.

Downside of this approach is we need to additionally implement "app uninstalled" event to correctly remove properties from OneDrive list.

## Used SharePoint Framework Version
