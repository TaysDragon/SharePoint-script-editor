## Minimal Path to Awesome

The quickest path to building the web part and running it with mock data:

 * Obtain API keys for [Bing Maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingmaps/getting-started/bing-maps-dev-center-help/getting-a-bing-maps-key) and [Open Weather Maps](https://openweathermap.org/api). In src/webparts/fieldVisitTab/, copy constants.sample.ts to constants.ts and add the API keys.
 * npm install
 * gulp serve

To work with real data, the web part requires content to be in place including:

* A Microsoft Team
* Calendar items in the Team's shared calendar, encoded with Northwind database customer IDs
* Documents and photos in SharePoint

[Detailed setup instructions are here](./documentation/setup.md).
