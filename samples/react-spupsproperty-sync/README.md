# SPUPS Property Sync

## Summary
This component will help the administrators who are currently maintaining the user profiles in their organization. Since not all the properties from Azure are synced automatically to **SharePoint UPS**, this solution will help administrator to synchronize specific properties (default or custom) from Azure or maintained in a separate system directly to **SharePoint UPS** using property import. Below are the features
* **Property Mapping** will provide a flexible and user-friendly way to pick the properties to be synced.
* **Templates** can be generated based on the '_Property Mapping_'.
* Download the generated templates in both **CSV** & **JSON** format.
* **User selection** to allow you to update only the users whose properties are changed or yet to be updated.
* **User selection** method will allow the admin to update both 
    * **Manually** entered properties or which are maintained in a separate system
    * Properties from **Azure AD**
* **Bulk Sync** will allow the admin to upload the data using the templates generated. They can also use this templates as a base for exporting the data from other system and then feed them here to update the properties.
* **Access control** based on **SharePoint Group**, not all the users can access the applictaion.
* **Anytime access** to the template files generated with different property set and the files uploaded for bulk update.
* Separate section to check the **status** of the property update. **Detailed status** on each property and also display the overall status.
* **Azure Function** to handle the property update. **PnPPowershell** is used in Azure Function.
* The application supports **SPA**.

> **_Note_**: All the supporting lists were created when the web part is loaded for the first time. Whenever the web part is loaded, the supported lists were checked whether it exists or not.

## Properties

2. **Azure Function URL**: Azure function URL to run the property update silently.

3. **Use Certificate for Azure Function authentication**: The video mentioned below to setup Azure Function has different options. This setting will decide whether to use the certificate or stored credentials to communicate with SharePoint.
