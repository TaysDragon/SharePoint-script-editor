# Consuming SPFx Service Scopes using React Hooks

## Summary

This web part is designed to help developers understand how to use the Context API and useContext() React Hook to share global data between a hierarchy of nested React components. In this example, a Service Scope is shared globally that components can consume to call the Microsoft Graph, it also uses Functional Components replacing the more commonly seen Class Component approach.

## Features

This sample demonstrates how 
 
 * Functional Components can be used to replace Class Components, simplifying the codebase
 * `useEffect()` React Hooks can replace `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method 
 * `useState()` React Hook can replace the use of `this.setState()` to update local component state

This Web Part illustrates the following concepts on top of the SharePoint Framework:

* React Hooks
* React Context API
* Functional Components
