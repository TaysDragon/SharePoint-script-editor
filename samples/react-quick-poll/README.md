# React Quick Poll

## Summary
> This component is developed for the users who really need to create a **_Poll_** within a minute and with less maintenance. **_'QuickPoll'_** list will be created automatically to store the user response.  
> Following are some of the features of this component.
* **_Easy_** to setup with most of the configurations are optional.
* **_Flexible_** to use without any critical configuration.
* More than one poll questions can be added.
* Schedule the poll questions in **_advance_** using the **_date_** parameters.
* Option to choose the poll that has to be visible to the end users.
* Poll response can be viewed via graphical representation as **_charts_**.

## Properties

1. **_Display poll based on date_** - This property will check for the **'Start Date'** and **'End Date'** on the poll questions to display the correct poll question to the end user. The **'Start Date'** and **'End Date'** on the poll question will be enabled only when this property is turned on.

2. **_Poll Questions_** - Manage the collection of poll questions and choices.
    
    * **_Question Title_** - Title of the question.
    * **_Choices_** - Choices separated by comma.
    * **_Multi Selection_** - Whether the users are allowed to choose one or multiple.
    * **_Start Date_** - Date when the end user can start seeing the poll question.
    * **_End Date_** - Last day of the poll question visible to the end user.

3. **_Success Message_** - Message to be displayed to the user after successful submission. It is optional, if not provided the default message '**Thank you for your submission**' will be displayed.

4. **_Response Message_** - Message to be displayed to the user with the user response, once the user has submitted. It is optional, if not provided the default message '**You voted for: ~User Response~**' will be displayed below the chart.

5. **_Submit button text_** - Text to be displayed on the submit button. It is optional, if not provided the default text '**Submit Vote**' will be displayed.

6. **_Preferred Chart Type_** - Chart type to display the overall response for the question.

### _Note_
* Poll questions with the same **'Start Date'** and **'End Date'** will follow the sort order to display the latest question to the end user.
* Once the user started to response to the poll, do not delete the question from the question collection. All the questions are mapped based on the **ID** auto generated. It cannot be recovered once deleted.
* Make sure the **Multi Choice** option is chosen wisely, do not change once the user started to response to the poll.
