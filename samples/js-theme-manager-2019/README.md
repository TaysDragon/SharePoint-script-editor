# Modern Experience Theme Manager

## Summary
This sample web part provides a user interface for applying a Modern Experience theme in SharePoint 2019 on-premises.

The Theme Palette can be generated using the UI Fabric Theme Generator at: https://fabricweb.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr-deploy-site/refs/pull/9318/merge/theming-designer/index.html.

### The following feature is available within this sample:

#### Apply a theme:
By providing a Site Collection URL, along with a theme name and palette, the theme will be applied to the Site Collection directly without being added to the tenant Company Theme options.<br>
NOTE: This is a great option to provide theme management of a Site Collection without adding a theme to the "Company Themes" choices within the "Change the Look" options at the tenant level. The web part could be added to a Site Collection App Catalog to ensure availability of the web part is only available to those approved for theme management.
