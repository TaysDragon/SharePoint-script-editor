# React Inversion Of Control Web Part with Unit Tests using Jest and Enzyme

## Summary
This web part is provided as an example of implementing an IoC (Inversion of Control) pattern, primarily to enable unit testing, in the context of a SharePoint Framework web part.

Following this pattern greatly improves the modularity, maintainability, and testability of the code.

The example includes 100% test coverage, using Jest and Enzyme, of .ts and .tsx files, excluding *WebPart.ts files. A dependency resolver class specific to a web part class is used to map web part properties to component properties and create any dependent services/providers. 

This pattern is implemented to separate testable logic from the untestable *WebPart.ts file and hence ensure that all relevant web part logic is tested. To this end, a Service class is paired with a ServiceExecutor class which should extract the actual service requests from other service logic ensuring that the Service class remains fully testable. *Executor classes are excluded from test coverage as they cannot be unit tested by design - as they are points integration.

Included in the coverage is a cache and logger class, along with a service class that fetches data asynchronously using @pnp/sp 2.x

The example also includes a pipeline definition .yaml file for Azure DevOps CI build pipeline (/pipelines/) which includes the build, running tests, and posting the test coverage results.
