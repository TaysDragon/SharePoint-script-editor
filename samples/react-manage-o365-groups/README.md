## Manage Office 365 Groups with SPFx

### Summary 
Office 365 Groups is the foundational membership service, that drives all teamwork across Microsoft 365. Once in a group, we can get the benefits of the group-connected services like shared Outlook inbox, shared calendar, SharePoint site, Planner, Power BI, Yammer, and Teams.

Is there a way to see all Office 365 Groups in a tenant?
*Yes, partially. You can view and manage your own groups in Outlook on the web.* 

This SPFx solution goes beyond this limitation and provides below functionalities using MS Graph APIs:
1. List all public and private groups with basic information (name, description, privacy, logo, etc.)
2. Search the group
3. Join and leave public groups
4. Join a private group with approval of group administrator (using Power Automate flow) and leave the private group
5. Manage group link for administrators
6. Browse MS Teams associated with group
7. Set up new group

# Prerequisites

- Administrative access to Azure AD of Office 365 tenant
- Permissions to create a flow in Power Automate (prior MS Flow)
- Set up Power Automate flow for approval to join private group. Please refer [Calling Graph API from Power Automate Flow](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/calling-graph-api-from-power-automate-flow/)
- SharePoint Online tenant 
- Site Collection created under the **/sites/** or **/**- 
- You need following set of permissions in order to manage Office 365 groups. Find out more about consuming the [Microsoft Graph API in the SharePoint Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-aad-tutorial)
```
"webApiPermissionRequests": [  
    {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Group.Read.All"
    },
    {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Group.ReadWrite.All"
    },
    {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Directory.Read.All"
    },
    {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Directory.ReadWrite.All"
    },
    {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Directory.AccessAsUser.All"
    },

# Minimal Path to Awesome

- Clone this repo
- Navigate to the folder with current sample
- Restore dependencies: `$ npm i`
- Bundle the solution: `$ gulp bundle --ship`
- Package the solution: `$ gulp package-solution --ship`
- Locate the solution at `./sharepoint/solution/react-manage-o365-groups.sppkg` and upload it to SharePoint tenant app catalog
- You will see a message saying that solution has pending permissions which need to be approved:
![Pending permission requests](./assets/pending-permission-requests.png)
- Approve the permission requests. There are [different options available](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-aadhttpclient#manage-permission-requests) - new SharePoint Admin UI, PowerShell, [`$o365`](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/) cli. 
- For the matter of this sample, the fastest way to do it is through new SharePoint Admin UI. 
- Open Web API permission management page by navigating to the url `https://<tenant>-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/online/AdminHome.aspx#/webApiPermissionManagement` (change the `<tenant>` to your O365 tenant name) or by going to the new Admin UI directly from old SharePoint Admin Center. 
- Select pending requests and approve it:
![Approve request from new Admin UI](./assets/approve-request.gif)
- Run `$ gulp serve --nobrowser`
- Open hosted workbench, i.e. `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<your site>/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx`
- Search and add `O365 Groups Manager` web part to see it in action
